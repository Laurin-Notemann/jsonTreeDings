One issue that I’ve noticed is the way a backpack waist strap makes your jacket bunch up and blocks access to the pockets. We addressed this problem by attaching the bottom of the lower pockets on this jacket with magnets. This keeps the pockets close to your body but lets you flip them up and place the backpack waist strap underneath. Being able to always access whatever’s in your pockets is convenient and it creates a clean look for a jacket that pushes performance in every respect.

There isn't a day that goes by when I don't think about Craig. I've got a picture of him over my bathroom sink. There's even a mural of him outside my hallway window, and when it snows, it looks like Craig is ripping right outside my house.   <br></br>  Craig's passion for progression and the sport is still teaching all of us about what matters in snowboarding. It was Craig who made freeriding a respectable day job. For a long time, Craig was considered the best snowboarder in the world. To rule the competitive side of the sport like he did, then retire from contests and make a successful pro career out of filming …Craig started all that, and every pro freerider owes their career to him. He also taught me to really listen to riders, to take their feedback to heart and to let them drive the product design process and the company.   <br></br>  I made this shirt and jacket as one more way to honor the memory of one of my closest friends and favorite people to ride with. Craig's partner, Savina Kelly and their daughter, Olivia, worked with me on the project. Olivia asked that proceeds go to the Land Trust Alliance, which works to conserve the places people like Craig
